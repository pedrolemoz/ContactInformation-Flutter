## What I learned with this project?

This is a very simple application. It's just an app to display who I am and some contact information.

I learned about how I can start my Flutter project, how widgets work with some properties, such colors, styles, and the most used widgets: ```Column``` and ```Row```.

In addition, I figured out how to work with alignments, positioning and some tricks (like using the ```SizedBox``` to get some space between two widgets).

Finally, I learned a lot about the ```pubspec.yaml``` file, and how to add assets and fonts to my projects, and how to display these properly in my application.
